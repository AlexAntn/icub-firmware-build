# Simple FW update  
# Here are some simple instructions updating the FW on an ETH board and on the attached CAN boards.
# The same information but with much more details can be found in sections (3), (4) and (5) of the document howto-eth-boards-programming.txt

    
   
(1) Update of the application FW 

    Use the ethLoader.

    (a) Power motors on, launch the ethLoader on the PC104, press the button "Discover" it until the GUI shows that the running process 
        of the target ETH board is "eUpdater".
    (b) Load the relevant binary file (e.g., ems.hex) from the EMS/bin/application/ folder. If update is successful, the right window shows an OK message.
    (c) Check that the FW version is correct by pressing button "More Details".
    (d) Check also that the process #2 has the property "DEF". If not, press the button "DEF2RUN = eApplication", press again the button "More Details" 
        to be sure that the command was effective.
    (e) After all operations, if you want to use the robot you must restart the ETH boards by pressing "Restart Board" on ethLoader or by powering motors 
        off and back on and wait for some time.
    

(2) Update of the CAN boards connected to the ETH board

    Use (the ethLoader and) the canLoader.

    (a) Power motors on, launch the ethLoader on the PC104, press the button "Discover" it until the GUI shows that the running process 
        of the target ETH board is "eUpdater".        
    (b)  Launch the canLoader, choose "ETH" from the proper menu, specify the wanted IP address and the wanted CAN bus (CAN1, CAN2, or CANx for both)
    (c)  Press "Connect". 
    (d)  If there are CAN boards the canLoader will print them on the GUI.
    (e)  You can select one or more CAN boards and perform FW update or whatever you need to do (change address, set additional info, etc.). At the end press
         the "Disconnect" button.
    (f)  After all operations, if you want to use the robot you must restart the ETH boards by pressing "Restart Board" on ethLoader or by powering motors 
         off and back on and wait for some time.
