strain2: how to migrate from 128k to 80k version


starting march 2019 the strain2 uses a different mapping of internal flash which places
the application at 80k. before this date the strain2 assumed the application to be at 128k.

mapping 128k

application                         [128k,  256k)
sharedstorage+applicationstorage:   [124k,  128k)
bootloader:                         [000k,  126k)
   

mapping 80k

applicationstorage: [256k,  256k)
application         [080k,  252k)
sharedstorage:      [078k,  080k)
bootloader:         [000k,  078k)

the mapping at 128k can be recognised because application and bootloader all have major number = 1.
if you attempt to program a board with a 128k system with a 80k application then the application space will be
written inteh wrong way and you shall recover only by getting the bootloader (which is ROBUST and will NOT BE
damaged).


as a consequence of that, both the bootloader and the application must be changed.

here is the procedure to follow if you find a 128k board.

1. verify with the FirmwareUpdater which application version there is. If the version is vers 2.x.x
   then the strain2 is already in 80k mode and there is no need to continue.
   if else the version is vers 1.x.x then keep on.
   
2. enter in the calibration window of the firmware updater and:
   a. write down the serial number: SNxxxx
   b. save the calibration file of the strain2. it will be saved with name calibrationDataSNxxxx.dat
   
3. you are now ready to upload the special application called: strain2.128k.updaterofbootloader.hex
   at the end of the operation the FirmwareUpdater will show an application with version: 1.2.222
   
4. now you can upload the new bootloader: strain2.bootloader.hex 
   when the operation is completed, you have to restart the eth board and perform a discovery of the can boards.
   if nothing is found do:
   a. select the eth board and press restart.
   b. wait for 1 second at most and press discovery.   
   at this point you should find the bootloader running version 2.0 with address = 13.
  
5. upload the new strain2.hex binary.
   at the end of operation you should find the application version 2.0.1 or higher.
   
6. now you must open the calibration window and load the file calibrationDataSNxxxx.dat which
   you saved in step 2. remember to save to eeprom.
